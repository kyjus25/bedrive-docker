# bedrive-docker

Finally got this working

## Few Things to Note
• May need to give the BeDrive folder 777 permissions.<br>
• May need to change the host URL if not hosting on localhost directly.<br>
• Default user is kyjus25@gmail.com / Password123. Feel free to add more inside the admin area.<br>
• This took a long time to finally get right.
